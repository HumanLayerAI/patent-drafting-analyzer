## What It Does

A live, interactive Claude artifact that analyzes patent claim language and identifies potential vulnerabilities in IP protection. The system examines claim scope, dependent claim structure, means-plus-function limitations, and prior art exposure risks.

Rather than providing generic patent guidance, the artifact applies structured legal analysis frameworks to help inventors and practitioners examine their claims with prosecution-aware precision.

## Why I Made This

Patent drafting is one of the most technically demanding forms of legal writing. A single poorly-worded claim can cost companies millions in lost protection or litigation exposure.

This artifact exists to demonstrate how **structured legal analysis** can be embedded into AI systems to provide actionable, prosecution-grounded feedback—making patent quality review more accessible and systematic.
